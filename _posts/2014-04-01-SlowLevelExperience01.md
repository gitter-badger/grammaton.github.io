title: Slow Level Experience #01
---

**Slow Level Experience #01** is an acousmatic composition. Maybe. While I was working on *Decadenze* which is a work originated starting by percussion sounds, I have developed a kind of sound processing that generated long sound structures. One of these structures proved to be immediately interesting to me. So in addition to insert a statement in the song for which it was created, I decided to keep it in an autonomous form.
